1)What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
ans) The .gitignore file is a text file located in the root directory of repo which is responsible for letting the git know which type
of files it should avoid while commiting our project in GitHub repository. For a java project the .gitignore should include file types
such as .class, .jar, .project, .settings which are created for temporary usage and doesn't need SCC. It also includes file types which are
generated by IDEs.  

2) What does fast-forward in git mean?
ans) Fast forwarding helps in commiting the end changes which are made in the featured branch and moves the tip of the main
branch to the ending of member's feature branch which helps in saving the time of commiting the similar changes multiple times
instead of a three way merge.

3)Why should you have different branches?
ans) Adding changes directly into the main branch is not feasible as team members work on different bugs which are included
in different sprints. Tracking the changes could be difficult and if there are any mistakes made to the main repository while merging,
whole branch gets affected and it may result in loss of information. By having different branches people can create their own
working braches and add changes in them and can raise merge requests(to main branch) to get them approved before adding them to the main branch.

4)In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
ans) In a project we only have one remote repository for which team members can clone the remote repository into their local and 
create as many number of local repositories and work on their changes which can be merged later into the remote repository.
